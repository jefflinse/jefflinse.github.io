      <description>Want to start encrypting right away? Skip to GitHub or install the package.
 When programatically storing a secret value in a repository for use in a GitHub Actions workflow, you must first encrypt the value using libsodium. If you want to do this in Golang, there are basically two choices: bind the libsodium C library, for which there are Go packages available1, or use APIs provided by the golang.</description>
