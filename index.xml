      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer for WarnerMedia in Seattle, WA where I build cloud infrastructure, tools, and services to support our on-premises datacenter and, more broadly, client development for HBO MAX. I&amp;rsquo;m currently immersed in Golang, Docker, SNMP, and a handful of AWS services including Lambda, IoT, and API Gateway.
I also happen to be an avid homebrewer and amateur neuro-evolution hobbyist, as some of my side projects would suggest.
You can reach me by emailing jeff at jefflinse dot com or via LinkedIn.</description>

      <description>A handful of projects that I pick away at or maintain in some sort of official capacity.
critters Critters is a evolution simulator in which creatures evolve to adapt to their environment.
githubsecret githubsecret is a Go package for encrypting secrets to be used in GitHub Actions workflows.
handyman Handyman is a tool for composing and running configuration-based CLI apps. It began as a way to scratch an itch when I got tired of managing an army of aliases and shell scripts for my various projects.</description>
